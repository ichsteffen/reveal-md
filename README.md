# [Reveal-md](https://patarapolw.github.io/reveal-md/reveal/)

Reveal.js x Markdown (Showdown.js) editor, CLI and viewer.


## Features

- Read Reveal Markdown (Reveal-md) online at `https://patarapolw.github.io/reveal-md/reveal/?q=<URL>`
- CLI script to editor and read Reveal-md totally offline (no internet connection needed)
- Customizable via `git clone` / `git submodule add`, then edit these files
  - [/reveal/src/index.scss](/reveal/src/index.scss)
  - [/reveal/src/plugins.ts](/reveal/src/plugins.ts)
  - [/reveal/src/defaults.ts](/reveal/src/defaults.ts)


- Minimal [/dist/reveal/index.html](/dist/reveal/index.html) generated by [/reveal/](/reveal/) to host for your own.
- Host your own version of Reveal-md on <https://zeit.co/>, <https://www.netlify.com/> or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for online viewing (at `/reveal/?q=<URL>`)


- Reveal-md is based on [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com), so can navigate not only left-and-right, but also up-and-down.
- Reveal.js options are customizable via [YAML front-matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/).
  - For example, `shuffle: true` -- Try it!
- But not only Reveal.js options, but also
  - `theme:` as can be seen in this example


## How to create Reveal-md

- Global scripting `<script></script>` and styling `<style></style>` is also supported in slides marked with

```markdown
// global
content (CSS, Pug, HTML or extended Markdown)
```

- The slides marked with `// global` or `// hidden` will be hidden.


HTML is also supported.

```html
<small>Small character</small>
```
// slide
```html
<small>Small character</small>
```

Furthermore, you can reference other online CSS urls via
- `// css=<URL>`


## Installation of CLI editor

```
npm i https://github.com/patarapolw/reveal-md.git
```


Or,

```
npm i -g https://github.com/patarapolw/reveal-md.git
```


It might possible to use Yarn as well, but NPM is confirmed to work, especially for `npm i ./reveal-md` (which will create symlink instead of copy files.)

```
git submodule add https://github.com/patarapolw/reveal-md.git
cd reveal-md && npm i
cd ..
npm i ./reveal-md
# This will create symlink, but `yarn add ./reveal-md` will copy to `node_modules`
```


## Usage

```
reveal-md [options] <fileOrDir>

Read file or directory or in reveal-md

Positionals:
  fileOrDir  Path to the file or directory to read

Options:
  --version   Show version number                                      [boolean]
  --edit, -e  Edit the file in editor                                  [boolean]
  --help      Show help                                                [boolean]
```


## Additional features of CLI editor

- `// css=<FILE_PATH>` also works


To add external JavaScript, you will have to edit
- [/reveal/src/index.scss](/reveal/src/index.scss)
- [/reveal/src/plugins.ts](/reveal/src/plugins.ts)


## Save as HTML (and associated assets folder)

This is best done by [downloading complete web page, in associated web browser](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/save-complete-webpage-offline-reading/).

Using web crawlers, like <https://github.com/website-scraper/node-website-scraper> won't work, because some JavaScript in Reveal.js is dynamically injected.


## Online viewer

You can do it at `https://patarapolw.github.io/reveal-md/reveal/?q=<YOUR_URL_HERE>`


## Create your own version

- Clone this project
- Build `/editor/` and/or `/reveal/`, and the following environmental variables can be set if needed.
  - `BASE_URL=` -- needed for GitHub Pages
  - `NO_EDITOR=` -- if you don't want to build the editor. Build the `/reveal/index.html` only.
